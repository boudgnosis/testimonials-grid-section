			<p class="text__general">"I was an EMT for many years before I joined the bootcamp, I've been looking to
				make a transition and have heard some people who had an amazing experience here. I signed up for the
				free intro course and found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter. The next 12 weels was the
				best - and most grueling - time of my life. Since completing the course, I've successfully careers,
				working as a Software Engineer at a VR startup."</p>

			<p class="text__principal text__principal-blue">Such a life-changing experience. Highly recommended!</p>
			<p class="text__geral-blue">"Before joining the bootcamp, I've never written a line of code. I needed some
				structure from professionals who can help me learn programming step by step. I was encouraged to enroll
				by a former student of theirs who can only say wonderful things about the program. The entire curriculum
				and staff did not disappoint. They were very hands-on and I never had to wait long for assitance. The
				agile team project, in particular, was outstanding. It look my learning to the next level in a way that
				no tutorial could ever have. In fact, I've often referred to it during interviews as an example of my
				developent experience. It certainly helped me land a job as a full-stack developer after receiving
				multiple offers. 100% recommend! "</p>
